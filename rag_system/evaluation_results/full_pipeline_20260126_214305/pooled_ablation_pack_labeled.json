Efficient algorithms for storing, indexing and querying of data form the backbone of this course. More specifically, the following topics will be considered in the database systems course: The relational model and SQL Storage en Indexing Hash-based indexing (Linear, Extendible) Tree-based indexing (B+tree, ISAM) External Sorting External merge sort B+ tree sorting Buffer management Buffer replacement policies I/O Query evaluation Query optimization Join algorithms Cardinality estimation Query plans Transaction Management ACID Serializability Two phase locking Concurrency control Crash Recovery Checkpoints ARIES",

Next to this, the introduction covers the basics of DSP that CS Masters need to be able to do a first order analysis of wireless and mobile networks at the physical layer in order to plan out a realistic architecture. A deep dive starting from first principles into 5G which will allow students to understand the challenges and analyze current telecommunication networks. The student will end with sufficient basics to be able to find their way in the forest of standards and dig deeper in their professional career. A similar deep dive into WiFi, where we track from basics to the state-of-the-art and student will be able to place new developments into a broader context. At the end, we also cover other protocols by contrasting them with these two. This course consists of two parts.",

You are able to use the mininet network emulator and to implement basic control programs to solve network management tasks using the POX SDN controller. You understand the need for programming data planes and are able to implement simple data plane functionality in the P4 programming language. You are able to identify what AI/ML techniques should be used to solve what network management problems.

The course goes beyond the mere use of models to specify system requirements, designs (architecture, behaviour), and their deployment, to the explicit modelling of modelling languages. This meta-modelling not only gives deeper insight in exisiting modelling languages, but also allows one to design new, Domain-Speficific Modelling Languages (DSMLs). Syntax as well as Semantics of languages need to be specified. Graphs and their (rule-based) transformation play an important role in modelling and modelling language engineering as any kind of model can always be symbolically represented as a typed attributed graph. The many techniques (meta-modelling, model transformation, physics of notation, ...) and issues (trace-ability, debugging, modelling language evolution, ...) will be studied. In addition, the modelling of product families, by means of feature models, will be covered.",

It will be much less a matter whether you will find a job, but more whether you will find a job that matches your interests. All major challenges in science and technology in the current century are multidisciplinary in nature; i.e. several disciplines must bond together to create inspiring environments. Computer scientists play a pivotal role: they collect and organise the data to ensure that the numerous software systems, networks, algorithms can exchange information seamlessly.
