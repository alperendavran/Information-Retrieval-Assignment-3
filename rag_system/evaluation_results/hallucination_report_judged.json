Next to this, the introduction covers the basics of DSP that CS Masters need to be able to do a first order analysis of wireless and mobile networks at the physical layer in order to plan out a realistic architecture. A deep dive starting from first principles into 5G which will allow students to understand the challenges and analyze current telecommunication networks. The student will end with sufficient basics to be able to find their way in the forest of standards and dig deeper in their professional career. A similar deep dive into WiFi, where we track from basics to the state-of-the-art and student will be able to place new developments into a broader context. At the end, we also cover other protocols by contrasting them with these two. This course consists of two parts.",

Modelling formalisms vary in the level of detail in which they consider time (e.g., partial order, discrete-time, continuous-time), whether they allow modelling of sequential or concurrent behaviour, whether they are deterministic (mostly suited for system/software synthesis) or non- deterministic (mostly suited for modelling system environment effects, with subsequent safety analysis), whether they support a notion of spatial distribution, ... At the end of the course, you should be able to choose between (and explain why) and use appropriate formalisms for modelling, analysis, simulation and synthesis of diverse (software-intensive) applications. The above forms a starting point for more advanced topics. In particular, the combination of different formalisms and the development of Domain-Specific Modelling Languages. The latter is one of the topics of the course Model Driven Engineering.

Generally, EU students tend to pay lower fees compared to non-EU students. \n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding tuition fees, I recommend checking the official University of Antwerp website or contacting their admissions office directly, as fees may change and there could be additional costs for materials or other services.",
