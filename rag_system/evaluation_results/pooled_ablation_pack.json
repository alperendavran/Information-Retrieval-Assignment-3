The project is executed during the semester, and is submitted at the end of the last full week before the start of the exam period (either in May or in August). As a minimal requirement to pass the course, it is necessary to obtain at least 4/10 on each of the two course parts (and 10/20 on average over both parts together).

Efficient algorithms for storing, indexing and querying of data form the backbone of this course. More specifically, the following topics will be considered in the database systems course: The relational model and SQL Storage en Indexing Hash-based indexing (Linear, Extendible) Tree-based indexing (B+tree, ISAM) External Sorting External merge sort B+ tree sorting Buffer management Buffer replacement policies I/O Query evaluation Query optimization Join algorithms Cardinality estimation Query plans Transaction Management ACID Serializability Two phase locking Concurrency control Crash Recovery Checkpoints ARIES",

Next to this, the introduction covers the basics of DSP that CS Masters need to be able to do a first order analysis of wireless and mobile networks at the physical layer in order to plan out a realistic architecture. A deep dive starting from first principles into 5G which will allow students to understand the challenges and analyze current telecommunication networks. The student will end with sufficient basics to be able to find their way in the forest of standards and dig deeper in their professional career. A similar deep dive into WiFi, where we track from basics to the state-of-the-art and student will be able to place new developments into a broader context. At the end, we also cover other protocols by contrasting them with these two. This course consists of two parts.",

You are able to use the mininet network emulator and to implement basic control programs to solve network management tasks using the POX SDN controller. You understand the need for programming data planes and are able to implement simple data plane functionality in the P4 programming language. You are able to identify what AI/ML techniques should be used to solve what network management problems. You are able to identify the upcoming challenges in the Future Internet and how to tackle them by combining new network management technologies and network automation based on AI.",

The course goes beyond the mere use of models to specify system requirements, designs (architecture, behaviour), and their deployment, to the explicit modelling of modelling languages. This meta-modelling not only gives deeper insight in exisiting modelling languages, but also allows one to design new, Domain-Speficific Modelling Languages (DSMLs). Syntax as well as Semantics of languages need to be specified. Graphs and their (rule-based) transformation play an important role in modelling and modelling language engineering as any kind of model can always be symbolically represented as a typed attributed graph. The many techniques (meta-modelling, model transformation, physics of notation, ...) and issues (trace-ability, debugging, modelling language evolution, ...) will be studied. In addition, the modelling of product families, by means of feature models, will be covered.",

In order to pass the course, students need to obtain at least 40% on both components, and a passing grade in general. Hence, only a limited form of compensation between the two components is possible. In case the student passes the course, the assigned grade will be the average of the two components, otherwise the lowest of the two grades will be assigned. written exam (50%): closed book exam with questions testing the theoretical topics covered in the course. The evaluation is based on the understanding of the data mining techniques and algorithms, their theoretical foundations, capabilities and limitations. individual assignments (50%): The students have to carry out 4 assignments related to pattern mining, recommender systems, classification, and clustering respectively.",

In a corporate organisation you can work as a technology consultant, software designer, system developer, software architect, software analyst, web designer and developer, project leader, industrial researcher... Many computer scientists end up in the Research and Development departments of industrial organisations (both large and small) to address technological challenges of all kinds. Your background allows you to deal with fast changing environments; which is a necessary prerequisite for project management positions. A scientific career in academia where you think about in depth problems of computer science.

Its final deliverable, the thesis document, is an original written text that is to demonstrate the student’s theoretical insight in and practical experience with the methods, techniques and tools that are applied in scientific research within a particular subdomain of Computer Science. The research activities related to the thesis can be executed within the context of a research group within the Master of Computer Science, or within a external organisation (e.g. a company). In the latter case, the Master's Thesis is linked to an internship within said company and an additional external supervisor. When? Although the master’s thesis is formally registered in the curriculum as a 2nd semester course, students are expected to work on their thesis during the entire academic year, given the magnitude of the work. Therefore, the subject and promotor choice can already be prepared in the year that precedes the master’s thesis. In any case the choice has to be made in the first weeks of the year in which the student enrols for the master’s thesis. The registration of a thesis subject and promoter occurs in two phases.",
