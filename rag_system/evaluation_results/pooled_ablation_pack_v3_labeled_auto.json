You understand the need for programming data planes and are able to implement simple data plane functionality in the P4 programming language. You are able to identify what AI/ML techniques should be used to solve what network management problems. You are able to identify the upcoming challenges in the Future Internet and how to tackle them by combining new network management technologies and network automation based on AI.",

Assignments are made in teams of one ore two students. The exact weight of exam and assignments depends on concrete discussions during the first class of the semester. It is however typically 25% (exam) and 75% (assignments). To pass the course, you need to attend/submit and orally defend every part (theory exam and each and every assignment) of the course. If not, your grade will be \"AFW\" - absent. If you do attend/submit every part, you still need an overall score of 50% to pass the course. Additionally, if for at least one part (theory exam, or any assignment) your score is strictly below 40%, your overall grade will be min(7, your_score).",

The ability to reproduce from memory concepts and ideas is not the focus. The student should also be able to apply the concepts, ideas, techniques, etc... to specific examples, given a prompt or domain. Both first and second sessions exams are similar; for foreign students, an alternative examination approach in case of second session can be provided. Example exams will be provided.",

Efficient algorithms for storing, indexing and querying of data form the backbone of this course. More specifically, the following topics will be considered in the database systems course: The relational model and SQL Storage en Indexing Hash-based indexing (Linear, Extendible) Tree-based indexing (B+tree, ISAM) External Sorting External merge sort B+ tree sorting Buffer management Buffer replacement policies I/O Query evaluation Query optimization Join algorithms Cardinality estimation Query plans Transaction Management ACID Serializability Two phase locking Concurrency control Crash Recovery Checkpoints ARIES",

Next to this, the introduction covers the basics of DSP that CS Masters need to be able to do a first order analysis of wireless and mobile networks at the physical layer in order to plan out a realistic architecture. A deep dive starting from first principles into 5G which will allow students to understand the challenges and analyze current telecommunication networks. The student will end with sufficient basics to be able to find their way in the forest of standards and dig deeper in their professional career. A similar deep dive into WiFi, where we track from basics to the state-of-the-art and student will be able to place new developments into a broader context. At the end, we also cover other protocols by contrasting them with these two. This course consists of two parts.",

Specifically with a deepening of knowledge in 5G and WiFi. The student has a good overview of wireless and mobile networks in use and to be in use in the near future, in the area of public cellular networks, wireless LAN, wireless personal networks, ad hoc networks and sensor networks. The student can study the behavior of contemporary wireless and mobile systems (performance, robustness, scalability, etc.) using models and simulations.",

After these concepts are covered, the students take a look at different performance metrics and security techniques in Wi-Fi networks. Finally, the students will use dedicated hardware that runs Openwifi (https://github.com/open-sdr/openwifi) in order to play with more advanced settings that are usually inaccessible in commercial Wi-Fi chips. 5G The students start by designing a 5G network that is specifically tailored to a given use case. In a second step, the students get familiar with OpenAirInterface (https://gitlab.eurecom.fr/oai/openairinterface5g), configuring and setting up their previously designed 5G network in a virtual environment. Finally, the students will deploy their virtual 5G network on real hardware and perform some real-life tests.",

Modelling formalisms vary in the level of detail in which they consider time (e.g., partial order, discrete-time, continuous-time), whether they allow modelling of sequential or concurrent behaviour, whether they are deterministic (mostly suited for system/software synthesis) or non- deterministic (mostly suited for modelling system environment effects, with subsequent safety analysis), whether they support a notion of spatial distribution, ... At the end of the course, you should be able to choose between (and explain why) and use appropriate formalisms for modelling, analysis, simulation and synthesis of diverse (software-intensive) applications. The above forms a starting point for more advanced topics. In particular, the combination of different formalisms and the development of Domain-Specific Modelling Languages. The latter is one of the topics of the course Model Driven Engineering.

The course goes beyond the mere use of models to specify system requirements, designs (architecture, behaviour), and their deployment, to the explicit modelling of modelling languages. This meta-modelling not only gives deeper insight in exisiting modelling languages, but also allows one to design new, Domain-Speficific Modelling Languages (DSMLs). Syntax as well as Semantics of languages need to be specified. Graphs and their (rule-based) transformation play an important role in modelling and modelling language engineering as any kind of model can always be symbolically represented as a typed attributed graph. The many techniques (meta-modelling, model transformation, physics of notation, ...) and issues (trace-ability, debugging, modelling language evolution, ...) will be studied. In addition, the modelling of product families, by means of feature models, will be covered.",

The project is executed during the semester, and is submitted at the end of the last full week before the start of the exam period (either in May or in August). As a minimal requirement to pass the course, it is necessary to obtain at least 4/10 on each of the two course parts (and 10/20 on average over both parts together).

The data mining techniques that will be addressed are divided into the following categories: Classification: Standard classification techniques, such as k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, Bayesian classifiers, logistic regression, as well as techniques for combining classifiers in ensembles (bagging and boosting, random forest) important concepts: likelihood, regularization common issues: under- and overfitting evaluation measures and techniques for classifiers: Accuracy, precision/recall, AUC, hold-out, cross validation Clustering: k-means and k-medoids, density based clustering (DBSCAN), Expectation-Maximization-based clustering, hierarchical clustering Outlier detection Pattern mining: frequent itemset mining, subgroup discovery Recommender systems: user-user, item-item recommendation, collaborative filtering During the coverage of these topics, several foundational concepts in machine learning and data mining will be treated, such as bias-variance decomposition, maximum likelihood learning, minimal description length principle, etc.",
