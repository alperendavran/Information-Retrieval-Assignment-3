Its final deliverable, the thesis document, is an original written text\nthat is to demonstrate the student’s theoretical insight in and practical\nexperience with the methods, techniques and tools that are applied in scientific\nresearch within a particular subdomain of Computer Science. The research\nactivities related to the thesis can be executed within the context of a research\ngroup within the Master of Computer Science, or within a external organisation\n(e.g. a company). In the latter case, the Master's Thesis is linked to an\ninternship within said company and an additional external supervisor.\nWhen? Although the master’s thesis is formally registered in the curriculum as\na 2nd semester course, students are expected to work on their thesis during the\nentire academic year, given the magnitude of the work. Therefore, the subject\nand promotor choice can already be prepared in\nthe year that precedes the master’s thesis. In any case the choice has to be made\nin the first weeks of the year in which the student enrols for the master’s thesis.\nThe registration of a thesis subject and promoter occurs in two phases. In the\nfirst phase (to be completed by the end of June in the year preceding the thesis)\nthe registration is handled via ESP. The student who wants to start a thesis\nshould take initiative. The promotors verify whether all eligible students\nregistered a master’s thesis and sends a reminder to those who did not. In a\nsecond phase (to be completed in the 4th week of the academic year in which the\nstudent enrolls for the master’s) the choice of thesis subject and promoter is\nconfirmed in SiSA.

Having the competencies necessary for junior management\nfunctions, such as data gathering, analysis and interpretation; being able to\nsearch, find and develop the necessary information sources for doing so;\ncommunicating ideas, both in an oral (during discussions) and a written\n(reports) format; managing deadlines; etc.\nUnderstanding management jargon and work and function in multidisciplinary\nteams in companies.\n3. Course contents *\nIn the theoretical part, concept and trends in strategy and organisation are\ndiscussed. Attention is guided towards basic concepts and terminology such as\nmarket dynamics, strategy types, sustainability, etc. Specific attention goes to how\nstrategy and planning can be formulated from two different perspectives: industrial\neconomics and the ‘Resource Based View’.\nIn the practitioners part, that runs parallel to the theoretical part, applications\nare developed based on analysis of an industry and a company. Based on an\nobjective analysis of the environment, students develop a frame to understand and\nevaluate the strategy of a real company. This way, students learn how to structure\nthe complex environment and learn to be critical in looking at companies\n4. International dimension *\nThis course stimulates international and intercultural competences.\nStudents use course materials in a foreign language.\nStudents reflect on their own cultural frame of reference in relation to other\nperspectives.\n5. Teaching method and planned learning activities\n5.1 Used teaching methods *\nClass contact teaching\nLectures\nPersonal work\nAssignments\nIn group\nCase studies\nIn group\n5.2 Planned learning activities and teaching methods\nThis course consists of (1) plenary sessions, and (2) individual (= group) feedback\nsessions. Plenary sessions and feedback sessions are not obligatory. However, only\ngroups that timely submit the predefined sub-assignment as a preparation for the\nfeedback sessions, will receive feedback. The feedback sessions will only be\norganized during the predefined feedback slots.\nClasses are not recorded.\n5.3 Facilities for working students *\nClassroom activities\nno specific facilities\n6. Assessment method and criteria *\n6.1 Used assessment methods *\nExamination\nWritten examination without oral presentation\n- Electronic\n- Closed book\n- Open-question\nSelf-directed assessment\nPeer-assessment (no second assessment period)\nOther assessment methods\nWritten assignment\n6.2 Assessment criteria *\nStudents will be evaluated as follows:\n1. Individual evaluation: exam (50%)\n2. Group evaluation: analysis report on a real-life case. (50%) Peer assessment.\nFor additional information: see course outline.\n7.

The promotor selects reviewers,\norganizes the thesis’ defense and takes responsibility for a fair assessment of\nthe thesis. At least one of the promotors of Research Internship I & II, and\nthe Master thesis should be different from the other two; that is: is not\nallowed to have the same promotor for all three courses : Research\nInternship I, Research Internship II, and the master thesis.\nAn optional co-promotor is an expert in the thesis’ domain who can take\nshared responsibility for the quality of the thesis’ content.\nAn assistant is a member of the Teaching Assistants (Assisterend Academisch\nPersoneel (AAP)) or Research Assistants (Bijzonder Academisch Personeel\n(BAP)) of the university who can be the student’s first point of contact for\nguidance.\nAn internship supervisor is a member of an organization outside of the\nuniversity that has commissioned an internship within the context of which a\nMaster’s Thesis can be completed.\nA reviewer is a person that takes shared responsibility for assessing the\nthesis. A reviewer needs to have obtained at least a Master’s degree.\nTypes?

At least one of the promotors of Research Internship I & II, and\nthe Master thesis should be different from the other two; that is: is not\nallowed to have the same promotor for all three courses : Research\nInternship I, Research Internship II, and the master thesis.\nAn optional co-promotor is an expert in the thesis’ domain who can take\nshared responsibility for the quality of the thesis’ content.\nAn assistant is a member of the Teaching Assistants (Assisterend Academisch\nPersoneel (AAP)) or Research Assistants (Bijzonder Academisch Personeel\n(BAP)) of the university who can be the student’s first point of contact for\nguidance.\nAn internship supervisor is a member of an organization outside of the\nuniversity that has commissioned an internship within the context of which a\nMaster’s Thesis can be completed.\nA reviewer is a person that takes shared responsibility for assessing the\nthesis. A reviewer needs to have obtained at least a Master’s degree.\nTypes? Typically, a Master thesis in Computer Science will be one of the following\ntypes (consult the guidelines on Blackboard for more information on each type):\nFeasibility Study\nCase Study\nComparative Study\nLiterature Study\nFormal Model\nSimulation\nProcess Evaluation\n4. International dimension *\nThis course stimulates international and intercultural competences.\nStudents use course materials in a foreign language.\n5. Teaching method and planned learning activities\n5.1 Used teaching methods *\nClass contact teaching\nPersonal work\nPaper\nIndividually\n5.2 Planned learning activities and teaching methods\nGuidelines for choosing a thesis topic and promotor, details on the proces of\ncompleting a thesis and submitting it can be found in the document on\nesp.uantwerpen.be.\n5.3 Facilities for working students *\nOthers\nSupervision The student and promotor define a work plan, possibly in consultation\nwith a co-promotor, internship supervisor or teaching assistant, for completion of\nthe Master’s Thesis. The plan also defines how the supervision of the work will be\narranged. (When will the parties concerned meet (bi-weekly / monthly / ...) ? How\nwill they contact each other (telephone / e-mail / after class / Skype) ? Who takes\nthe initiative (student / teaching assistant / ...?)\nThe student carries the final responsibility for the execution of the planning, for\npromptly pointing out potential problems, and for the submission of the thesis.\nThe promotor presents the student with the necessary feedback regarding to\nintermediate results, corrective supervision of the work, and suggests solutions for\nproblems raised. This is done in possible cooperation with the co-promotor,\ninternship supervisor and teaching assistant.\n6. Assessment method and criteria *\n6.1 Used assessment methods *\nOther assessment methods\nWritten assignment\nPresentation\nJury\n6.2 Assessment criteria *\nThe assessment can take into account the process (permanent evaluation), the\nfinal product (single evaluation) or both. Regardless of the assessment\nmethodology, each Master’s Thesis must at a bare minimum demonstrate that the\nstudent :\nhas independently gained insight in the subject matter;\nis able to present a complex subject matter at a level understandable by his\nfellow students\nThe detailed assessment criteria and their impact on the final grade can be found in\nthe assessment forms, part of the document Guidelines Master Thesis Computer\nScience (see esp.uantwerpen.be).\nJury For each individual thesis, the promotor will select two reviewers. That\nnumber can be extended if called for. At least one reviewer must be associated\nwith a research group different from the promotor’s. A co-promotor (if present)\nalways fulfills a reviewer role. An internship supervisor (if present) always\nfulfills a reviewer role. A teaching assistant never fulfills a reviewer role, but\ntakes on an advisory role.\nDefense The defense consists of an oral presentation, possibly including a\ndemonstration, during which the student concisely summarizes his work,\nfollowed by a question and answer session. Every attendee is entitled to ask\nquestions to which the student is to respond to the best of his/her abilities.\nCopied Code - Code created by Generative AI\nFor implementations supporting the master thesis work, students may copy code\nfrom the internet, but must do so explicit attribution of the source where it is\ncopied from. Students may use generative AI tools for the code adopted in their\nmaster thesis, but must do so with explicit acknowledgment, i.e. it must be clearly\nindicated which code was created by which tools. During the thesis defence,\nstudents may be asked to elaborate on how they used generative AI.\nSupport from generative AI\nStudents may use generative AI tools as for writing the master thesis, similar to\ninitial search engines such as Google and for checking grammar and\nspelling. During the thesis defence, students may be asked to elaborate on how\nthey used generative AI.\n7. Study material\n7.1 Required reading *\nThe research group informs the student about compulsory reading and study\nmaterial for the master project.\n7.2 Optional reading\nThe following study material can be studied voluntarily :\nThe research group informs the student about recommended reading and study\nmaterial for the master project.\n8. Contact information *\nAll contact details of the promotors can be obtained via\nhttps://www.uantwerpen.be/en/staff/\n9. Tutoring\nInform yourself. Investigate the different thesis subjects on the ESP system\n(https://esp.uantwerpen.be/) and attend the information session (details will\nbe communicated by email). This way, make a subject choice for which you have a\nprofound interest.\nInvest sufficient time in planning and follow-up.\nTake initiative. You carry the ultimate responsibility for the execution of the\nplanning, for promptly pointing out potential problems, and for the submission\nof the thesis. Take sufficient initiative with respect to these actions."

    "course_description": "Modelling of Software-intensive Systems\n2025 - 2026\nIs part of the next programmes:\n- M0012004 Master of Computer Science: Software Engineering\n- M0012005 Master of Computer Science: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence\n- M0012006 Master of Computer Science: Computer Networks\n- M0048004 Master of Computer Science: Software Engineering\n- M0048005 Master of Computer Science: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence\n- M0048006 Master of Computer Science: Computer Networks\n- M0090004 Master of Teaching in Science and Technology: Computer Science\n- U0001008 Courses open to exchange students in Sciences\n1. Prerequisites *\nspeaking and writing of:\nEnglish\nspecific prerequisites for this course\nObject-oriented programming. Both theory and assignment parts of the course\nuse the object-oriented scripting language Python. If Python is not yet known, it\nis advisible to prepare for the course using a Python tutorial.\nBasics of object-oriented design (notions of UML, design patterns)\nBasic linear algebra and calculus\n2. Learning outcomes *\nKnowledge of different formalisms: various UML diagrams, Modelica, Causal\nBlock Diagrams, Petri Nets, Statecharts, Event Scheduling, DEVS, Forrester\nSystem Dynamics. Understanding the similarities and differences between\ndifferent formalisms. Be able to choose between (and explain why) and use\nappropriate formalisms for modelling, analysis, simulation and synthesis of\ndiverse (software-intensive) applications. The above forms a starting point for\nmore advanced topics. In particular, the combination of different formalisms.\n3. Course contents *\nThis course will introduce you to the different kinds of complexity we have to deal\nwith when designing large software-intensive systems. This complexity will be\ntackled using different modelling formalisms, each appropriate for specific\nproblems/aspects: various UML diagrams, Modelica, Causal Block Diagrams (aka\nSynchronous Data Flow), Petri Nets, Statecharts, Event Scheduling/Activity\nScanning/Process Interaction Discrete-Event, DEVS, Forrester System Dynamics.\nControl Theory will also be briefly introduced with focus on the development of an\noptimal (embedded, software) controller.\nThe goal of the course is to gain understanding of the similarities and differences\nbetween different formalisms. Modelling formalisms vary in the level of detail in\nwhich they consider time (e.g., partial order, discrete-time, continuous-time),\nwhether they allow modelling of sequential or concurrent behaviour, whether they\nare deterministic (mostly suited for system/software synthesis) or non-\ndeterministic (mostly suited for modelling system environment effects, with\nsubsequent safety analysis), whether they support a notion of spatial distribution,\n...\nAt the end of the course, you should be able to choose between (and explain why)\nand use appropriate formalisms for modelling, analysis, simulation and synthesis\nof diverse (software-intensive) applications.\nThe above forms a starting point for more advanced topics. In particular, the\ncombination of different formalisms and the development of Domain-Specific\nModelling Languages. The latter is one of the topics of the course Model Driven\nEngineering.\nCourse topics:\n1. Causes of Complexity\n2. Unified Modelling Language (UML) notations\n3. Requirements vs. Design\n4. System Specification\n5. Equation-based Object-Oriented Languages (in particular, Modelica)\n6. Basics of Control Theory (bang-bang, PID controller)\n7. Causal Block Diagrams (CBDs): discrete-time en continuous-time\n8. Petri Nets\n9. Statecharts\n10. Event-Scheduling Discrete-Event\n11. Discrete-EVent System Specification (DEVS)\n12. (Forrester) System Dynamics\n13. Cellular Automata\n4. International dimension *\nThis course stimulates international and intercultural competences.\nStudents use course materials in a foreign language.\nThe lecturer invites international guest lecturers.\nStudents give presentations in a foreign language.\nStudents write papers in a foreign language.\nThe lecturer collaborates with an international partner (fe. joint course\nmaterials, joint case studies).\n5. Teaching method and planned learning activities\n5.1 Used teaching methods *\nClass contact teaching\nLectures\nPractice sessions\nPersonal work\nExercises\nAssignments\nIndividually\nIn group\n5.2 Planned learning activities and teaching methods\nThe 10 topics each take at least 1 week (Statecharts and DEVS each two weeks).\nAn assignment is given about each important formalism.\nThere are two types of assignments: (1) the implementation of the operational\nsemantics of a formalism and (2) the use of a formalisms for the\nmodelling/analysis/simulation/synthesis of a complex problem.\n5.3 Facilities for working students *\nClassroom activities\nno specific facilities\n6. Assessment method and criteria *\n6.1 Used assessment methods *\nExamination\nWritten examination without oral presentation\n- Closed book\nContinuous assessment\nExercises\nAssignments\n6.2 Assessment criteria *\nEvaluation consists of on the one hand a closed-book exam and on the other hand\nof a series of assignments during the semester. Assignments are made in teams of\none ore two students. The exact weight of exam and assignments depends on\nconcrete discussions during the first class of the semester. It is however typically\n25% (exam) and 75% (assignments).\nTo pass the course, you need to attend/submit and orally defend every part (theory\nexam and each and every assignment) of the course. If not, your grade will be\n\"AFW\" - absent. If you do attend/submit every part, you still need an overall score\nof 50% to pass the course. Additionally, if for at least one part (theory exam, or any\nassignment) your score is strictly below 40%, your overall grade will be min(7,\nyour_score). your_score is the score you would get when applying the weights\ngiven above.\n7. Study material\n7.1 Required reading *\nThe material (articles and notes) are available on the public course website\nhttp://msdl.uantwerpen.be/people/hv/teaching/MoSIS/\nThe ultimate reference are notes on the blackboard during the classes.\n7.2 Optional reading\nThe following study material can be studied voluntarily :\nOpen Access textbook:\nPaulo Carreira, Vasco Amaral, Hans Vangheluwe. Foundations of Multi-Paradigm\nModelling for Cyber-Physical Systems. Springer, 2020.\nhttps://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-43946-0\n8.

    "course_description": "Reinforcement Learning\n2025 - 2026\nIs part of the next programmes:\n- M0012004 Master of Computer Science: Software Engineering\n- M0012005 Master of Computer Science: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence\n- M0012006 Master of Computer Science: Computer Networks\n- M0048004 Master of Computer Science: Software Engineering\n- M0048005 Master of Computer Science: Data Science and Artificial Intelligence\n- M0048006 Master of Computer Science: Computer Networks\n- M0090004 Master of Teaching in Science and Technology: Computer Science\n- M0119000 Master of Digital Business Engineering\n- M0119000 Master of Digital Business Engineering\n- U0001008 Courses open to exchange students in Sciences\n1. Prerequisites *\nspeaking and writing of:\nEnglish\nextra commentary:\nThis course is thought in English. A thorough knowledge of the English language is\nthus necessary.\nspecific prerequisites for this course\nThis course requires knowledge on Artificial Intelligence. For students who did\ntheir bachelor at the University of Antwerp, this means that you must have\nsuccesfully completed the course \"Artificial Intelligence\" in the bachelor\nprogramme. Moreover, the course requires knowledge on deep neural networks. If\nyou do not yet have this background, it is important that you also participate in\nthe course \"data mining\" as these aspects will be taught in parallel in that\ncourse.\nAdditionally, this course requires knowledge of programming and a broad\nprogramming experience (with different languages).\n2. Learning outcomes *\nYou are able to define the key characteristics of reinforcement learning and how\nit differs from other AI solutions\nGiven an AI problem, you are able to identify whether this can be modeled as a\nreinforcement learning problem or not. If so, you are able to recommend and\napply the most appropriate technique within the RL family (deep RL or not,\nwhich type of deep RL algorithm, etc.)\nYou are able to implement an RL algorithm successfully so that it can effectively\nsolve a control task.\nYou have a thorough understanding of when RL can be applied, when not to\napply it and what type of problems you might run into.\nYou have theoretical knowledge of the fundamentals of reinforcement learning\nsuch as theoretical convergence, computational complexity, etc.\nYou have a good view on the recent breakthroughs of reinforcement learning and\nthe open research challenges.\nYou are able to apply reinforcement learning in a distributed setting.\n3. Course contents *\nIn a distributed world, consisting of multiple sensors and actuators, there is often a\nneed to automate processes and design strategies to control the \"knobs in the\nworld\". Examples are:\nHow can we configure industrial processes in a factory setting through AI?\nHow can we navigate properly in a self-driving car?\nHow can we design certain strategies in a competitive game so that we get a\nbetter advantage?\nReinforcement learning provides a promising approach to this: based on trying out\nactions in a clever way, it learns the best strategy for making good decisions.\nRecently, reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to application\ndomains such as board games (the Google AlphaGo program), robotics, etc.\nIn this course, we will cover the basics of reinforcement learning and explain the\nrecent breakthroughs in successfully scaling up reinforcement learning to high-\ndimensional environments (deep reinforcement learning). Moreover, we will\nexplain how reinforcement learning is applied in practical applications and how it\ncan be integrated into distributed environments.\n4. International dimension *\nThis course stimulates international and intercultural competences.\n5. Teaching method and planned learning activities\n5.1 Used teaching methods *\nClass contact teaching\nLectures\nSeminars/Tutorials\nLaboratory sessions\nPersonal work\nAssignments\nIndividually\nProject\nIn group\n5.2 Planned learning activities and teaching methods\nThe theoretical part mainly consists of lectures, explaining the basics of\nreinforcement learning and deep reinforcement learning. Active participation will\nbe encouraged through in-class exercises and small-scale projects.\nThe practical part consists of individual lab sessions, where small scale\nreinforcement learning applications will be built in the form of a number of\nprogramming excercies. These programming exercises can partly be performed\nduring the weekly lab sessions, but a continuation of this work at home will also be\nrequired.\nA detailed overview of the course schedule, combining lab sessions and lectures, is\nuploaded on Blackboard and discussed during the first lecture.\n5.3 Facilities for working students *\n6. Assessment method and criteria *\n6.1 Used assessment methods *\nExamination\nWritten examination without oral presentation\nContinuous assessment\nExercises\n6.2 Assessment criteria *\nThe theory and lab session part (=programming exercises) are given an equal\nweight in the evaluation. However, a score of 8/20 or higher is required for each\npart in order to achieve a global score and potentially pass. If this score is not met,\nyour score is divided by 2.\nDuring the year, partial exemptions are possible as follows:\nYou can receive a partial exemption of the project if you receive more than 10\nout of 20. In that case, you do not need to retake the project again during the\nsummer if you fail for the theory part.\nYou can receive a partial exemption of the theory if you receive more than 10 out\nof 20. In that case, you do not need to retake the theory exam again during the\nsummer if you fail for the project.\nPartial exemptions are only valid in the same academic year. If you need to redo the\ncourse, any partial exemptions are\nThe theoretical exam will be in a closed book and written form. The lab sessions (=\nprogramming exercises) consists of applying the theoretical material to hands-on\ncases. A resit (theory and project) is offered during the regular re-examination\nperiods. If you need to resit the project, you will receive a modified assignment.\n7. Study material\n7.1 Required reading *\nThe course material for the lectures consists of the lecture slides and documents to\nwhich is referred in the slides. Additionally, we require the book: Reinforcement\nLearning: An Introduction, by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto\n(http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html)\nThe assignment of lab sessions will be made available on Blackboard. All\ncommunication regarding the lab sessions occurs through Blackboard.\n7.2 Optional reading\n8. Contact information *\nQuestions regarding the theoretical part\nSteven Latré - Steven.Latre@uantwerpen.be\nKevin Mets - Kevin.Mets@uantwerpen.be\nQuestions regarding the lab sessions: To be announced\n9. Tutoring\nBoth the lecturer and the teaching assistant are available for additional questions\n(see above).\nThe lab session is considerable and complex because of the interaction between\ndifferent technologies. Please make sure that you start early and do not postpone."
