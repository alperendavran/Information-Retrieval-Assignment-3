Computer scientists play a pivotal role: they collect and organise the data to ensure that the numerous software systems, networks, algorithms can exchange information seamlessly. For instance at the CERN lab, computer scientists mediate between physicists and engineers. Similarly in the human genome project, computer scientists ensure that doctors and biochemists can exchange the complex information encoded in DNA strings.</p>\n<p><strong>The modern economy with its emphasis on global competition and sustainable development poses interesting challenges </strong>for computer scientists. New industrial systems, implementation and optimisation of specialised software, networks with higher performance and security, faster computation cycles — these all present opportunities for young computer scientists.</p>\n<h3>Career opportunities</h3>\n<p>Just a sample of career opportunities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In a <strong>corporate organisation</strong> you can work as a technology consultant, software designer, system developer, software architect, software analyst, web designer and developer, project leader, industrial researcher...</li>\n<li>Many computer scientists end up in the <strong>Research and Development departments</strong> of industrial organisations (both large and small) to address technological challenges of all kinds.</li>\n<li>Your background allows you to deal with fast changing environments; which is a necessary prerequisite for <strong>project management positions</strong>.</li>\n<li>A scientific career in <strong>academia</strong> where you think about in depth problems of computer science. Together with other scientists and companies you work inside European or international projects on a variety of disciplines.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On top of these sectors there are a number of application areas with great economic significance and technological value where computer scientists can make a difference: alternative energy sources, high performance computing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, wireless communication, self healing materials, superconductors, semi-conductors...</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n</div>",

Consequently there is ample room for practical work and - not surprisingly - group work. Former graduates informed us that independence and maturity are strengths of programme.\n\nBesides project work, there is also time for experiments and exercises in the computer lab. We have the necessary technical infrastructure and ensure that it keeps pace with the natural evolution in the field.\n\n# Laptop profile\n\nWe expect students to bring a regular laptop running Linux and/or Windows (MacOS often suffices, but support may be limited). Operating system: Modern medium range GPU. University computing servers will be used for demanding computations.\n",

      "markdown": "1. Analysis for large-scale informatics projects. Identifying tasks that qualify for automation, understanding underlying business processes, determining the corresponding consumer needs. This requires the necessary knowledge for fluent communication with people working in other disciplines.\n\n2. Design of large-scale informatics systems. Abstraction and decomposition of the specific problem to arrive at a feasible solution. Identifying components that could contribute to a solution (e.g. software library, type of network, kind of database). Documenting the chosen solutions on different levels of abstraction.\n\n3. Restructuring existing informatics systems. Identifying problematic components, selecting solution strategies, implementing the necessary adjustments without compromising the existing system’s functioning.\n\n4. Quality control. Planning the necessary check-ups while carrying out informatics projects in order to attain the previously specified quality standards (as to reliability, practicality of maintenance, safety …). Drawing lessons from informatics projects that have been carried out, in order to optimize quality norms wherever necessary.\n\n5. Selecting techniques, methods, languages, architectures, taking into account their inherent limitations and the fact that information on concrete solutions is usually commercially coloured. Making strategic decisions in this respect: e.g. how do we protect our network? What type of database? What role for formal specifications? Scientific motivation of the decisions that have been made.\n\n6.

Programs in which computer science was studied as a minor often lack in this respect.\n- Is there a solid mathematics background? Does the curriculum include advanced courses on discrete mathematics, linear algebra, calculus, and statistics? Coverage of these topics is often an issue in more application-oriented studies.\n- Does the curriculum cover theoretical computer science subjects? This includes the study of data structures, algorithm analysis, and computational complexity. Coverage of these topics is often an issue in more IT management, Informatics-like or Electrical Engineering-oriented bachelor’s programs.\n\nHow to demonstrate that you meet the programme specific requirements\n\nYou are required to indicate how you meet these programme specific admission requirements through our prescreening form.\n\nThis prescreening form is an essential element in this assessment, for the Board of Admissions and for yourself. Make sure to complete it rigorously and honestly. Based on your transcripts and the pre-screening form, the Board of Admissions checks if there is a good match of the topics covered by your Bachelor's program and our Bachelor's in Computer Science. The subjects are grouped into \"Computer skills\", \"math skills\", \"theoretical computer science\", \"databases\", \"software engineering\", and \"computer networks\". The board’s flexibility on which of these groups are not covered by courses you have taken is very limited. Also, self-study is only taken into account as reinforcement in a group where insufficiently many courses are listed, not as a replacement.\n\n- [Master Computer Science - Prescreening form](https://medialibrary.uantwerpen.be/files/51127/d35b914d-fb6c-4527-8166-3ef18658248f.pdf)\n\n3.      Language requirements\n\nThe programme is taught in English and an academic level of proficiency in this language is imperative.\n\nCandidates with a bachelor degree from universities outside Flanders are required to demonstrate their English language skills in by submitting one of the language certificates listed [here](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/admission-and-enrolment/admission/master-and-advanced-master/admission-requirements/).\n",

Protocol design. Designs algorithms and protocols fo optimal use in contemporary systems (wireless networks, cloud computing, …). Analyzes and optimizes such algorithms ans protocols depending on the context in which they are to be used.\n\n13. Modelling and simulation. Studies the behaviour of contemporary systems (performance, robustness, scalability, ...) using models and simulations.\n\n14. Mathematical modelling. Assesses if a certain mathematical model is suitable in a given situation. Quickly makes (small) adjustments to, or a variant of an existent model. Abstracts and models simple problems and gains necessary insights from the obtained results.\n",
